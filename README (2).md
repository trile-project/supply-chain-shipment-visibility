# Supply Chain Shipment Visibility Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes shipment execution performance across transportation modes, carriers, and regions to evaluate service reliability and identify the root causes of late deliveries. It simulates a real-world supply chain analyst workflow commonly used in large logistics and e‑commerce organizations.

**Business Problem:**  
Late shipments negatively impact customer experience, operational efficiency, and logistics cost. This project provides end‑to‑end visibility into service performance and highlights opportunities for operational improvement.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)  
- Microsoft Excel  
- Power BI  

## Key KPIs
- On‑Time Delivery (OTD %)  
- Late Delivery Rate  
- Average Lead Time  
- Carrier Performance  
- Exception Analysis  
- Cost vs. Service Trade‑off  

## Analysis Performed
- Carrier performance scorecard development  
- Transportation mode performance comparison  
- Regional service reliability analysis  
- Root cause analysis of late shipments  
- Cost vs. service evaluation

## Key Insights
- Certain carriers handle high shipment volume but demonstrate lower service reliability  
- Ocean transportation presents the highest lateness risk  
- Warehouse backlog is a primary exception driver  
- Priority shipments exhibit distinct cost vs. service trade‑offs  

## Business Recommendations
- Reallocate priority volume toward high‑OTD carriers  
- Implement control tower alerting for proactive exception monitoring  
- Standardize service level targets by transportation mode  
- Introduce predictive late‑risk detection to enable proactive intervention
